# qcbm_hiwi

This repository consists of Quantum Machine Learning HiWi work at DFKI under Dr. Maximilian Kiefer. The main works in this repository include -

1. Work related to Conservation Law Based Quantum Generative Models.
2. Variational Quantum Classifier benchmarks for the paper "QuKAN: A Quantum Circuit Born Machine Approach to Quantum Kolmogorov Arnold Networks"

This work mainly focuses on understanding the learning and generalization limitations of Quantum Circuit Born Machines (QCBMs), and extension to its applications on few areas such as image generation, edge detection tasks etc.
